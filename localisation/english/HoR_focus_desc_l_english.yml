 CAR_carnian_revival_desc:0 "Our country has been in disarray ever since Daria attempted to sell us off to the Imperium. We must end our endless internal conflict and focus inward, towards rebuilding our nation from the ashes."
 CAR_new_possibilities_desc:0 "Our core lands are already developed and ripe for further expansion, but also littered with ruins. If we developed the empty fields around the borderlands, we could speed up construction overall."
 CAR_invest_in_the_north_desc:0 "No longer can the south be considered the core of Carnian lands. New settlements like Illevianne and Praestennia are thriving, and with enough investment, may prove a much more stable base in the future."
 CAR_industrial_heartlands_desc:0 "Our core lands may be developed, but they are in severe disarray. If we clear away ruins and repurpose old farms, we can greatly improve our production capabilities in areas that are safer from attack."
 CAR_imperial_capital_desc:0 "Lestria is the true heart of Carn - spiritually and culturally, and it is also the most developed and urbanized piece of Carnian land. However, as it stands now, it is severely lacking in modernized infrastructure and many of the projects originally proposed by Kerplis have never been completed. \n This changes now."
 CAR_carnian_renaissance_desc:0 "The Carnian renaissance was a great movement, but has largely fizzled out. Where are the songwriters and sculptors, where are our best and brightest when we need them the most? The time has come for a second revival of ancient Carn, better than ever, this time under the government’s careful oversight."
 CAR_aegmerist_revivial_desc:0 "We made a mistake when we abandoned our dark lord - ever since we did our nation has been in decline, and we have clearly lost his good graces. The time has come to once again embrace the Man with the mask of porcelain, this time for all eternity!"
 CAR_lestrian_university_desc:0 "Instead of worshiping ungrateful gods who do nothing but scorn us, we must unite under the banner of our collecting learning and wisdom, studying the ancient classics as well as creating new knowledge of our own, and educating our population en masse."
 #Political Section
 CAR_struggle_for_power_desc:0 "Struggle for Power"
 # Democratic Section
 CAR_liberal_ideas_desc:0 "Our country struggles under the rule of a single monarch, especially when said monarch does not have the strength to reign over us in this crisis. The time has come for Shaereleria to assemble a council of nobles to aid in reform, and give the people of Carn a greater say in what goes in it."
 CAR_limiting_caeroneal_authority_desc:0 "Recent times have shown that having a single monarch in power can only lead to doom. The Caeron’s council must assume a direct role in governance rather than just advising Shaereleria, otherwise our desired liberalization will never be achieved."
 CAR_shaeroneal_council_desc:0 "For too long our nation has been a glorified oligarchy, where only the lucky few to be in kinship with the Caeron have the power to do much of anything at all. The provincial governors know the struggles of the common man, and they may now take part in a new branch of our parliament - the Council of Shaerons."
 CAR_lestrian_forum_desc:0 "All Carnian citizens must have the right to participate in politics, to have their words not only be heard but also abided by. While the Caeron and their council will still hold executive power, legislature should be passed at the Lestrian forum, where our population will collectively decide on the future of the Caeronate."
 CAR_repopulate_morvanne_desc:0 "The borderlands are unruly and their governors treacherous. They still cling to the dogmatic teachings of Daria, and are a threat to the very existence of our nation. If we moved our military to Morvanne, to directly oppose these rebels, they would have no chance of open revolt."
 CAR_synneian_militias_desc:0 "The people of the borderlands are unruly, but perhaps their anger could be redirected elsewhere. The Lirgalyn, and the Sironians! It is they who are the source of all our troubles! And if we just put them to the sword, we will have no need to think of what the Caeron is doing back home…"
 CAR_hold_a_grand_gathering_desc:0 "With all our reforms complete, the time has come to call a grand gathering, and hope on the people to decide wisely for what is the right course of our nation. Caeron Shaereleria would never abdicate if we demanded it, but perhaps looking the popular vote in the eyes might convince her otherwise."
