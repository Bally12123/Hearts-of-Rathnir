His bony, towering body and his manipulative charisma would create shivers in his political opponents as much as his calm and almost soothing voice. His rise to power didn't happen over night. It was carefully crafted and planned against the council of the Posavertican Union. Even though he was a part of it he never saw it as effective as it was meant to be. Soon his army sieged the capital building and forced out the goverment. Though nobody was killed due to Vallens thought that "all life is beautiful even though some don't know how to properly use it." All of the council was exiled and finally Vallen was able to achieve his industrial dream. But a problem faces Vallen.

When she was a young adult, she joined the Avarian army and would eventually serve with them during the 3rd coalition war. Eventually, she would settle down in her mid 20s to found a small town named Averti. After a revolution in Avaria, losing one of their eyes and the Free State of Avalisia not consulting their government ministers on decisions, Blueford Pen ended up founding an independent nation named The City State of "Avertico". This nation would end up becoming what we see today as Avertico, name at the time being the Pos-Avertican Union, but thanks to a corrupt minister in the nation, they, along with many unionists, have now been exiled to a small island off the coast and what is left of Avertico has become a corrupt Technocracy fueled of propaganda and lies. Blueford Pen now has to decide whether they will try to reclaim the mainland once again or accept their new fate and continue on with the status quo."
