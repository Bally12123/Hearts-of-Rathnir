LEADER_AVERTICO_MAGICALTICKET_DESC:0 "A inventor, a boogeyman and most importantly an architect of grand terror are just some names associated with Filipe Maxwell Vallen. The leader of the only Technocratic nation in the world of Rathnir. Born into a peasant family in Askalon, young Filipe received his education from Blandimir Petrovski, a man who would shape his understanding of the world and who would also take the role of his father due to Filipe's mother dying whilist giving birth and his actual father leaving him shortly because of socioeconomic reasons and his loyalty to the now gone UBSR.

LEADER_AVERTICO_TIPTHEIRISHGUY_DESC:0 "The Unloyal Senator of a Vallenist Regime, now Dictator of Avertico. Konan Tippensburg sets his ambitions on preserving the nation of Avertico and its peoples, unlike its terrored past of war and threat. Born in Miklagard. He moved to Averti at a young age after a disagreement with his father. He was never very attached to the man as he didn't prioritize childcare over ambitions. Once arrived he met a man by the name of Filipe M. Vallen who taught him the ropes of leadership, courage and politics, even giving him a little coastal town by the name of "Vantros". He has always been loyal to Filipe ever since he met him the very day and has been very patriotic about his nation, Avertico. His trust sadly diminished after the loss of Avaria by Avertico, Filipes rushed decision making causing the downfall of a soon to be powerful nation. Rumors of the state failing and Filipe being an unstable leader riddled his head, leading to what we have today. Konan taking power after an invasion from Viodoxa. He is now left to pick up the pieces left by his once leader, under an expansionist empire covering 2 continents. Either he can accept the fate of vassal-ship, or attempt to restore glory to the nation. Time will tell what he decides..."
LEADER_POSAVERTICO_BLUEFORDPEN_DESC:0 "Born in Askalon many years ago to the "Pen" family, Blueford, as a young girl, was very interested in the military and the technologies they used in warfare. She would always watch soldiers patrolling across the city of Askalon from her house. When she was a young adult, she joined the Avarian army and would eventually serve with them during the 3rd coalition war. Eventually, she would settle down in her mid 20s to found a small town named Averti. After a revolution in Avaria, losing one of their eyes and the Free State of Avalisia not consulting their government ministers on decisions, Blueford Pen ended up founding an independent nation named The City State of Avertico. This nation would end up becoming what we see today as Avertico, name at the time being the Pos-Avertican Union, but thanks to a corrupt minister in the nation, they, along with many unionists, have now been exiled to a small island off the coast and what is left of Avertico has become a corrupt Technocracy fueled of propaganda and lies. Blueford Pen now has to decide whether they will try to reclaim the mainland once again or accept their new fate and continue on with the status quo."
